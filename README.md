Have you ever dreamt of a standalone 'cd' command? Or, are you really tired of this awkward built-in into modern shells? Here it is ;).

It will work, in its current form, under GNU/Linux on an i386 platform only. Compiling with -m32 on an amd64 system will not help, unless your shell is compiled with -m32 too.
